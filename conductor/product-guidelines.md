# Product Guidelines: ClearMetrics Lab

## Brand Voice & Tone

### Core Principle: Scientific Authority

All communication should reflect **expertise, credibility, and trustworthiness**. Users come to ClearMetrics Lab for accurate, research-backed information—our voice must reinforce that we are a reliable authority.

**Characteristics:**
- **Data-Driven:** Claims are supported by research, studies, or transparent methodologies
- **Factual & Precise:** Avoid hyperbole, use specific numbers and measurements
- **Educational:** Explain concepts clearly without dumbing down the science
- **Confident:** Write with authority, but acknowledge limitations when appropriate

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:** "Our UV tracking algorithm uses NOAA solar radiation data and accounts for cloud cover, elevation, and time of day to provide accuracy within ±5%."

❌ **Avoid:** "We use super advanced AI to give you the best UV tracking ever!"

## Content Strategy

### SEO-Driven Scientific Education

**Objective:** Rank for high-volume problem-based keywords while delivering educational depth that competitors cannot replicate.

**Approach:**
1. **Keyword Research:** Target problem-focused queries with significant search volume (e.g., "how to track vitamin D levels," "best time for sun exposure")

2. **Scientific Depth:** Answer questions with evidence-based explanations:
   - Cite research studies and data sources
   - Explain underlying biological/physical mechanisms
   - Provide actionable, science-backed recommendations

3. **Competitive Moat:** Most competitors provide superficial answers. Our depth of scientific rigor creates a barrier they cannot easily overcome.

4. **Conversion Funnel:** Every blog post should naturally lead readers to a relevant ClearMetrics Lab app that solves the problem discussed.

**Content Checklist:**
- [ ] Targets a high-volume problem keyword
- [ ] Provides scientific explanation with sources
- [ ] Offers depth competitors lack
- [ ] Links to relevant app as solution
- [ ] Written in authoritative, educational tone

## Design System: Laboratory Signature

### The "ClearMetrics" Signature (Core Constants)

These elements remain **identical across every app** to create the recognizable "ClearMetrics Lab" brand:

#### 1. Typography System
- **Font Family:** Clean, high-readability sans-serif across all apps
- **Hierarchy:** Consistent sizing and weight scales
- **The "Voice":** Whether fitness or physics, the font remains the same—this is your laboratory's voice

#### 2. Card Language
- **Corner Radius:** 12-16px on all cards
- **Borders:** Subtle, consistent stroke weight
- **Container Style:** This card system is your signature packaging for data
- **Every app uses these exact same cards** to hold information

#### 3. Data Visualization Style
**This is your most important asset—the "came from the same laboratory" identifier:**
- **Line Thickness:** Consistent stroke weight across all charts
- **Data Points:** Dots at each measurement point
- **Grid Lines:** Same style background grid
- **Dual Y-Axis:** When needed, same left/right scale pattern
- **Data Labels:** Point values displayed on graphs
- **Chart Polish:** Professional, scientific appearance

**Rule:** A heart rate graph in one app and a light frequency graph in another should be visually identical except for the data and accent colors.

#### 4. Information Density
- **Dashboard Feel:** High-density "PhD/Lab" style information layout
- **Statistical Summaries:** Max, Avg, Min standard across apps
- **Data-Rich:** Users expect detailed metrics, not simplified views
- **Progress Indicators:** Percentage changes, trends, estimates

#### 5. UI Patterns
- **Whitespace:** Generous, clean spacing
- **Shadows:** Subtle, consistent depth
- **Tab Navigation:** Bottom bar pattern
- **Light/Dark Modes:** Full support for both themes

---

### Per-App Variables (Market Differentiation)

These elements **change per app** to give each product its own market identity:

#### 1. Primary Accent Color
The dominant brand color that defines the app's personality:

- **Workout Lab:** Vibrant Emerald Green (vitality, "go", energy)
- **Future App (Sleep Tracker):** Deep Indigo (calm, rest, night)
- **Future App (Focus/Timer):** Electric Orange (urgency, attention, heat)

**Usage:** Primary CTAs, selected states, progress indicators, active elements

#### 2. Gradient Buttons
- **Pattern:** Blue-to-[Accent] gradient (e.g., Blue → Emerald Green in Workout Lab)
- **Consistency:** Same gradient style, different end color per app
- **High Impact:** Used for primary actions

#### 3. Secondary Accent Colors
Supporting colors for data visualization:
- **Workout Lab:** Orange for Reps in charts
- **Other Apps:** Could use Pink, Yellow, Cyan, etc.
- **Purpose:** Differentiate multiple data series in same graph

#### 4. Iconography Subject Matter
- **Stroke Weight:** Identical across all apps (same icon library)
- **Subject:** Changes based on app domain (dumbbells vs. sun vs. brain)
- **Style:** Same visual language, different symbols

### Example: Cross-App Consistency

**Scenario:** User has both Workout Lab and Vitamin D Tracker installed

**What they recognize as "ClearMetrics":**
- Same card style and typography
- Charts look like they came from the same data lab
- Information density and dashboard layout feel
- Quality of animations and polish

**What differentiates the apps:**
- Workout Lab: Emerald green accents, blue-to-green gradients, fitness icons
- Vitamin D: Warm yellow/orange accents, blue-to-yellow gradients, sun icons

**Result:** User thinks "These are both premium ClearMetrics Lab tools, but each solves a different problem."
