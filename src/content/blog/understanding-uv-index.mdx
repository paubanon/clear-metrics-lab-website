# Understanding UV Index and Vitamin D

The UV index is a key factor in vitamin D production. Here's what you need to know.

## The Science

Your skin produces vitamin D when exposed to UVB radiation. The amount produced depends on:

- **UV Index** - Higher index means more vitamin D production
- **Skin Type** - Darker skin requires more sun exposure
- **Time of Day** - Peak production occurs around solar noon
- **Season** - Winter sun may not provide enough UVB at high latitudes

## Using the App

Vitamin D Tracker takes all these factors into account to give you personalized recommendations for safe, effective sun exposure.
